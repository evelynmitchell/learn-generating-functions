I'll start by browsing Mike Zabrocki's MMM1 (Mini-Mathematical Monographs), on Ordinary Generating Functions (OGFs). I'll call it a book, even though it's on-line and only sixty-two pages -- five chapters.

He's exploring himself, and the book has some associated videos.
I can only try to judge whether it works for me.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

He sketches the required background, which I think I have. 

* I'm comfy with basic, high-school algebra.
* I can manipulate elementary functions: sin, cos, exponentials, logs, etc.
* I know summation notation, and I'm not frightened by infinite series
* I can differentiate and integrate, as long as it's not too sophisticated.

Good enough.

## Chapter 2: Generating Functions Neither Generate, Nor Are They Functions.

I have to admit I love the chapter title.

Generating functions are formal polynomials. There's no notion so far of taking them seriously as functions, but I've read that such polynomials can just be thought of as a ring, a field without guaranteed inverses or commutativity.

In other words, you can add, subtract, and multiply them. Polynomial multiplication actually is commutative, so I'd guess they aren't a field because some don't have inverses.

The coefficients of the polynomial terms are the elements of the series.

For now, they're just a notational convenience.

Next, before I go farther, I need to find out is whether I can write equations
in blogposts. If not, it's going to be tough to blog about generating functions.
